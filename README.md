# WARNING
This project really only works on the [SwitchCraft modpack](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/officialswitchcraft.863735), because of an [encoding issue with Computronics](https://github.com/Vexatos/Computronics/issues/256) (fixed, but has yet to make into an official release) and the programs usage of [CC: Tweaked](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/cc-tweaked)'s websockets, which [hasn't been merged into mainline ComputerCraft](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/pull/395).

# tapestream
A websocket server that transcodes audio streams from icecast or spotify to [DFPWM](https://wiki.vexatos.com/dfpwm) for playing live within ComputerCraft.
